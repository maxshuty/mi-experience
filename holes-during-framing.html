          <h1 class="major">Holes in house being framed | March, 2022</h1>

          <p>
            During construction we were doing an authorized walkthrough with the
            builder. We noticed some holes... in the walls. Not just a couple,
            they were all over the house! The holes looked like someone sloppily
            hacked them out with a hammer. Our realtor asked that these entire
            boards be replaced. We were assured the issue would be corrected.
            The way they corrected this was not by replacing the boards but
            putting a 2x4 board over the holes (see pic of the repair below).
          </p>

          <p>
            I can't say that I feel comfortable with the repair that was made to
            address all of these holes especially given the other major issues
            we have had with water coming in the house already.
          </p>
