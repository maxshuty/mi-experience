          <p>
            Our family was sleeping when we were suddenly woke by a loud
            explosion. The whole house shook violently. Panicked and scared we
            ran outside. After clearing the home of any immediate dangers there
            was something still lurking under the floors.
          </p>
          <p>
            After searching the house we could not find an immediate cause.
            After ensuring there was no danger we walked the house and found our
            floor was bowed upwards by several inches. After meeting with the
            builder they ripped the flooring out and determined a floor joist
            exploded. After the repair was made our quarter round trim was
            damaged and now shows visible cuts in them where they had to cut the
            trim to rip out the flooring
