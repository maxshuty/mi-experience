          <p>
            As we were getting ready for bed on rainy evening we couldn't help
            but notice wet floors and water quickly coming through our window
            seams as the rain poured down. At least is was just one window...
            right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Wrong. It was not just one window, but two of our windows were
            presenting the same issue. After contacting M/I Homes they agreed to
            send someone out to investigate the issue. After investigation it
            was deemed that the glass was bad for these two windows and needed
            to be replaced. The glass was replaced.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            M/I Homes corrected this issue at no charge to us. Having other
            windows leak is very worrisome for us.
          </p>
