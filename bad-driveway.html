          <h1 class="major">Bad Driveway | 2022 to 2023</h1>
          <p>
            I was debating whether to categorize this as a major or minor issue.
            Considering that a driveway replacement is thousands of dollars, I
            put it in the major category.
          </p>
          <p>
            After closing on our house the driveway was not poured yet. Around
            one to two months after closing we got scheduled to have our
            driveway poured. Yay, how exciting! After it was poured I went
            outside and one of the workers immediately confronted me and said
            "this driveway packed bad and left a dip in the middle". I thought
            to myself, how bad can it be?
          </p>
          <p>
            After waiting a week to drive on it we realized how bad it was - the
            dip was a narrow area that quickly dipped around 1 inch. It felt
            like an inverse speedbump every time we exited our garage - not to
            mention how annoying snowblowing or shoveling this area was during
            that winter.
          </p>
          <p>
            We called the construction manager immediately after this was
            reported to us. He had the asphalt manager come meet with us - and
            the three of us determined that it was a bad pour and needs to be
            redone. However, the asphalt manager said it would be best to wait a
            year and let everything settle before redoing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was where our mistake began - we never got it in writing that
            they will agree to redo this. We have text conversations back and
            forth with the construction manager stating such, but never signed
            any formal documents. After a year passed we contacted M/I and said
            "Hey, it's been a year - can we get our driveway replaced?"
          </p>
          <p>
            M/I Homes quickly denied our request and said at most they would be
            willing to patch the dip as it does not exceed 3" and is within
            their spec. We challenged this decision, but in the end we were left
            off with a sense that they are doing us a favor by their willingness
            to even patch this at all.
