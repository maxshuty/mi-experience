          <p>
            A month or two after we moved in we quickly noticed a big issue...
            the power in our basement went out regularly. The entire basement is
            on one GFCI line. This GFCI outlet consistently popped which shut
            off all power to the entire line - meaning our internet would go
            out. Our water heater would shut off. Our freezer full of food would
            shut off. Our air exchanger would shut off. Literally everything in
            our basement that uses power was gone when this occurred.
          </p>

          <p>
            At least it's easy to push the button in and reset the outlet,
            right?
          </p>

          <p>
            Wrong. The outlet would refuse to reset. This would last anywhere
            from the shortest time of 5 hours to the longest time of it being
            out an entire weekend without resetting. This issue always presented
            itself in rainy or snowy weather. We had electrician after
            electrician come out every time this happened. They had theories but
            could not figure out what the issue was other than "hey it looks
            like it's working now" (as it often takes days to get someone out).
            We were told it must be our freezer drawing too much. To prove that
            it was not our freezer we decided to run an extension cable through
            our house down to the freezer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pop! It happened again, our freezer was off the line. After dealing
            with this issue for a year and half and proving it was not our
            freezer I demanded they send someone out immediately while the issue
            was happening (which means an emergency call for them versus a
            scheduled call - aka it costs more money).
          </p>

          <p>
            Voila! The electrician came out and found that - and you won't
            believe this if you've read about our other major issues - water was
            leaking into the air exchanger and causing it to short out. The
            plumbing company was called to come repair the unit. They came out
            and attempted to repair it (and prevent water from getting into it).
            Their intial repair did not work as the unit kept shorting out. Then
            they came back and replaced the air exchanger with a new one. The
            issue has not occurred in roughly 6 months since the unit replaced.
