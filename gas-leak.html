          <p>
            As I went to the basement to grab some food from the freezer I
            noticed a very recognizable smell - gas. I immediately got a spray
            bottle with soap and water and sprayed our gas lines where the smell
            was coming from. Bubbles rapidly developed and the leak was located
            quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            For an emergency like this I circumvented reaching out to M/I Homes
            corporate warranty and repair departmeent and reached out direclty
            to the construction manager for the neighborhood. We were very
            fortunate in that a plumber was at another house that was being
            built and they were able to come out and repair this gas leak within
            an hour.
          </p>

          <p>
            I cannot help but imagine a scenario where this could have occurred
            and I didn't go to the basement to get food from the freezer, or if
            we were out of town, or any other number of situations where this
            would not have been caught and the potential outcome from those
            scenarios.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you'll notice there are not any pictures of this situation as
            that was the last thing on everyones mind as this situation was
            being handled.
