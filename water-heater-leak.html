          <p>
            This was not a maintenance issue. We have receipts of us having
            regular maintenance done by a licensed and insured plumbing company.
            Wrong. It was not just one window, but two of our windows were
            presenting the same issue. After contacting M/I Homes they agreed to
            send someone out to investigate the issue. After investigation it
            was deemed that the glass was bad for these two windows and needed
            to be replaced. The glass was replaced.
          </p>

          <p>
            We heard the usual "if this is due to not being maintained properly
            then you will be responsible for the repair" jargon.
          </p>

          <p>
            This issue was resolved at no charge to us as it was deemed that the
            water heaters pressure release valve went bad.
