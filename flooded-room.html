          <h1 class="major">Flooded Bedroom | October, 2023</h1>
          <p>
            On a cold rainy evening in October we were putting our 1 year old to
            sleep. As we closed her window blinds we discovered a nightmare
            scenario - the floor was completely flooded in her room spanning the
            width of her room, and going out several feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you've seen our other major and minor issues, you'll know that
            we've had our fair share of window issues. Many of the conversations
            have started with "If you left the window cracked open you will be
            responsible to cover this repair". To which I've always replied "of
            course, that would be <i>my</i> fault." Naturally I immediately
            checked the window - it was locked shut.
          </p>
          <p>
            I immediately reached out to M/I Homes who were proactive in sending
            a company called DryTech to come remove the water. This involved
            them tearing out the carpet in that area, the trim, and the drywall.
            Additionally we had to run an industrial fan for several days in the
            room rendering our 1 year olds room unusable. After the repair was
            made the room was unusable for around two weeks as the drying out
            process was being done and the insulation was removed. The issue was
            found to be a gap or hole between the window and it's surrounding
            that was not properly covered when the home was build. They had to
            tear the exterior trim from the house to repair this, in addition to
            fixing the interior.
          </p>
          <p>
            M/I Homes corrected this issue at no charge to us. Having future
            mold problems or this issue reoccurring is certainly worrisome for
            us.
          </p>
