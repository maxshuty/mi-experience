            This is a detailed list of many nightmarish issues we have faced in
            the process of building our home. This list covers what was fixed,
            what the builder has not been willing to fix, and is a summary of
            our experience building our home. You will find all of our major
            issues like our flooded basement, flooded upstairs room, holes in
            the house, and our floor joist explosion. Read on for more...
          </p>

          <h2>Minor issues</h2>
          <p>
            We've also had our fair share of minor issues that are detailed here
            as well. It goes without saying that no matter what house you
            purchase, no matter what builder you use if building, you are bound
            to have minor issues crop up. It's all about in the quality of
            repair and whether these are fixed well or not.

                As our family was sleeping we heard a loud explosion that shook

                and quickly ran outside. After inspecting everything in the home

                Our garage has always pooled water in it after rain or snow
                melt. Not a huge deal, but certainly an annoyance to squeege out
                frequently after bad weather. This is within spec according to
                communications with M/I warranty department.

                In addition to all of the all leaks we have had, our irrigation
                system was leaky from the moment we turned it on, and a separate
                hose bib started leaking around a year after moving in. Both
                were fixed.

                The above photo was taken during construction, however you can
                see in the lower left of the photo that the access panel is
                popped out. After we closed on the house it was still popped out
                like this, and refused to "click" into place. After two visits
                the plumbing company came out and replaced the panel.

              <h3>Sagging Internal Window Trim</h3>
              <p>
                Our window-woes don't end with the major ones listed in the
                section above. We've had minor issues with other windows like
                sagging trim on the interior of the window. The window company
                came out and removed the window, stuffed the trim back in it
                (hopefully secured it better, I'm not sure) and the issue has
                been resolved since that time. At the time of this writing
                another window has an identical issue to the one that was fixed
                previously. After contacting M/I warranty about this they let me
                know that my warranty has expired, however, there is still a
                manufacturers warranty and I need to work with the manufacturer.
                It's very scary that we are just out of warranty and having
                things go wrong with a 1.5 year old house.

              <p>
                During construction our home sat for months being exposed to the
                elements, no boards were put up over windows, the Tyvek wrap was
                tearing all around the home, and snow and rain were consistently
                getting into the home during construction.

                After closing we noticed that the trim above our windows was
                uneven. The gap on the left side of the image above is much

              <h3>Messes</h3>
              <p>
                During construction of our home we often noticed small messes,
                like this image of our sink having been used without the
                courtesy of at least rinsing it.

              <h3>Cracked and Dinged Exterior Cement Boards</h3>
              <p>
                After closing on our home we noticed several areas where our
                cement boards were cracked in half, had dings, or had other
                damage to them.

              <h3>Faucets and Showerheads Popped from Wall</h3>
              <p>
                All of our faucets and showerheads on the upper level have had
                this issue where they popped out of the wall and cannot easily
                be pressed back in. One bathroom has been fixed while we were
                out of the one year warranty to have the other fixed by the time
                it occurred there.

              <h3>Warped Trim</h3>
              <p>
                The trim board above our garage was severely warped where we
                could squeeze a finger through in some areas. After many four or
                five appointments from different individuals this issue was
                finally resolved.

              <h3>Poor Trim Alignment</h3>
              <p>
                Throughout the home the trim is aligned poor and is missing
                paint where two corner pieces meet.

              <h3>Nicks and Dings in the Trim</h3>
              <p>
                Throughout the home the trim had dings and nicks. We tried to
                catch as much of this as we could up front before closing. The
                "fix" for this was to simply apply some putty over these which
                is still visible.

              <h3>Paint Drips and Marks</h3>
              <p>
                During our final walk through of the home we noticed many areas
                like this which had paint drips or marks in areas they were not
                supposed to be. Many of these were addressed, however, I put
                this one on us for not spending even more time to find more of
                these issues. After marking off hundreds of spots on the
                cabinets, walls, floors, and ceilings there were inevitably
                spots we missed. We should have demanded another walk through or
                more time, but we did not.

              <h3>Missing Sod</h3>
              <p>
                Around one to two months after moving in we finally got sod.
                Except they did not fully sod our yard up to the property
                markers and were off by several feet as you can see by where our
                fence is compared to where the sod is.

          <p>
            Our experience has been less than thrilling. One of the things to
            consider is all of the time you need to set aside to have these
            issues addressed from initial reporting, to scheduling, to having
            contractors come out and fix it (often taking many appointments fix
            a single issue) and making this work around your work schedule.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many of our issues were addressed by M/I Homes and have since been
            resolved. This website is in no way saying that other homes they
            have or are building are going to have any of these issues, rather
            it is a summary of the experience and issues that we have had at our
            home.
